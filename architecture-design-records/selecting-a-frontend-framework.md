AppSheets is great for prototyping because there are UI tools to spin up new views from a flat table in minutes. It also handles cross-browser, cross-device support seamlessly. 
 
## Reasons to implement my own UI
* AppSheets 
  * Loads slowly at times 
  * Has limitations on what Views you can create
  * I feel like AppSheets isn't optimized for separating data by user - need to confirm - [looks like a good video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Z2qUTtxNFA)


## Requirements: 
* Runs in Browser, iOS, Android (or there's a path to get there)
* Modern
  * Accessible to more programmers
  * Supported for at least the next 5 years
